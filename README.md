# Assignment 
This is a project for a course when I was studying in EC Utbildning. I implemented the API using a library called FastAPI. I have different types of
routes/endpoints to fetch different types of data (GET), to create data (POST), to update data (PUT) and delete data (DELETE). I also integrate with a database. Logic to seed the database from a file (json), a separate script, and lastly a program capable of communicating with the API, a simple menu. 



# Project File Structure
